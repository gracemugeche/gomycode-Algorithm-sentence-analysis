# Sentence Analysis Program

## Overview
The **Sentence Analysis Program** is a simple yet powerful algorithm designed to analyze a sentence character by character. It reads a sentence that ends with a period (`.`) and determines:
- **The length of the sentence** (total number of characters).
- **The number of words** (assuming words are separated by single spaces).
- **The number of vowels** (both uppercase and lowercase vowels are counted).

This program processes each character individually, ensuring accuracy in counting words, vowels, and total characters.

## Why This Project Matters
This project is an excellent exercise in string manipulation, character handling, and control structures. It helps build fundamental programming skills such as:
- **Iteration and loops** (reading characters one by one).
- **Conditional statements** (identifying spaces and vowels).
- **Variable manipulation** (incrementing counters effectively).
- **Input validation** (ensuring the sentence ends with a period).

By implementing this project, developers can enhance their ability to break down text processing problems efficiently.

## Features
âœ… Reads a sentence character by character.
âœ… Counts total characters, words, and vowels.
âœ… Uses efficient control structures to process input.
âœ… Ensures clarity and correctness in handling sentence analysis.

## Evaluation Criteria
This project will be assessed based on the following:
- **Use of three counters (character count, word count, vowel count).**
- **Code clarity and documentation.**
- **Proper GitHub repository setup with a README file.**
- **Technical skills demonstrated.**
- **Problem-solving approach and overall code quality.**
